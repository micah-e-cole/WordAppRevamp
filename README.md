# WordAppRevamp
This project is a long-overdue update to a final project for a web development course. Initially the logic was all handled in the app.js file. A big part of this update was to shift from using data from a .csv file and to using a SQLite database. With the addition of a database, the ability to offload some levels of complexty from the app.js file, to handling difficulty settings could instead be passed from the database directly to the server.js handlers. 

### Additional Changes
The overall design of the web app is being adjusted as well, with future changes of a light/dark theme as well as optimized coloring for accessibility.# Test trigger
